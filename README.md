## Overview

This project involves the creation of five visualizations that explore different aspects of the **Carbitrage** dataset, which includes car listings from Craigslist. The visualizations range in complexity and aim to tell compelling stories about car trends, postings, and market dynamics.

Visualizations are categorized by difficulty:
- **Easy**: 3 visualizations
- **Medium**: 1 visualization
- **Difficult**: 1 visualization

The goal is to challenge and develop skills in data storytelling while showcasing insights from the data.

## Dataset

### Carbitrage

The **Carbitrage** dataset consists of car listings scraped from Craigslist across the U.S. It includes data such as car make, model, price, mileage, posting date, and geographic location. This dataset allows for the exploration of trends such as:
- The most popular car makes and models
- Posting frequency by location and time
- Relationships between car age, mileage, and other factors

This dataset will also be used in future dashboard projects, enabling interactive analysis for car shoppers and industry enthusiasts.

## Visualization Tasks

The following visualizations are created based on the **Carbitrage** dataset:

### Easy
- **Popular Car Makes and Models**: A visualization highlighting the most frequently listed car makes and models across the dataset.
- **Posting Rates Over Time**: A chart showing how frequently cars are posted (daily/weekly) across all locations.
- **Posting Rates by Location**: A map or chart illustrating the number of postings across different Craigslist locations.

### Medium
- **Posting Times by Location**: A visualization exploring when cars are typically posted in different locations, revealing any interesting patterns or anomalies.

### Difficult
- **Car Age vs. Mileage**: A detailed plot that captures the relationship between car age and mileage, filtered by specific makes, models, and year ranges provided by the user.

## Tools

- **R** with **ggplot2**: Used to create all visualizations, providing powerful tools for data analysis and visualization.
- **Ann Emeryâ€™s Data Visualization Checklist**: Each visualization is evaluated using this checklist to ensure clarity, accuracy, and visual appeal.
