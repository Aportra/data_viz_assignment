# TSWD: Data Visualization Assignment

## Introduction
Welcome to the assignment for Module 1 of _"Telling Stories with Data"!_ In this assignment, you will apply the knowledge and techniques you've learned about data-driven storytelling and data visualization.

## Assignment Overview
1. **Synthesis of Knowledge**  
   This assignment combines the concepts, tools, and methodologies covered in Module 1. Your task is to effectively communicate complex information through data visualization.

2. **Your Visualization Task**  
   You will create and submit **five distinct visualizations**. You can select from a pool of options with varying complexity levels.

3. **Choice of Visualizations**  
   Visualizations are categorized into three tiers:
   - **Easy Choices (7 options):** Choose any three.
   - **Medium Choices (3 options):** Choose one.
   - **Difficult Choices (3 options):** Choose one.

   The goal is to challenge you with a mix of easy, medium, and hard visualizations to diversify your skills and push your boundaries while still practicing foundational techniques.

   **Important:**  
   - Use **Microsoft Excel** or **Google Sheets** to create the visualizations. Graduate students selecting the technical option should use **ggplot** in R.  
   - For each visualization, go through Ann Emery's **data visualization checklist** and report your score. You can fill out the checklist PDF for each visualization and combine them into a single PDF for submission.

## Data Sources
The visualizations will be based on the following datasets:

### 1. Carbitrage  
A dataset from a personal project, scraping all cars listed on Craigslist across the U.S., focusing on how we can communicate insights to car shoppers or those interested in car trends. This data will also be used for the dashboard project.

### 2. The Dram Shop  
Data from a local tap house, analyzing patterns in drink sales. This data will also be used in a presentation project.

### 3. City of Missoula Unhoused Data  
Vital data concerning the unhoused population in Missoula, helping us understand demographics, patterns, and challenges faced by this population.

You can select visualizations from any dataset, but must adhere to the guideline of submitting three "easy," one medium, and one difficult visualization.

### Carbitrage Visualization Tasks

- **Easy:**
  - Build a visualization that illustrates the most popular car makes and models.
  - Visualize the rate at which new cars are posted (by day or week). Optionally, add location data.
  - Show the posting rates across various Craigslist locations (e.g., posts per week per location).
  
- **Medium:**
  - Create a visualization answering: _When are cars typically posted by location?_ Highlight interesting data features.
  
- **Difficult:**
  - Assume a user has given you a make, model, and optionally, a year range. Create a visualization capturing the relationship between car age and mileage for that make/model.

### The Dram Shop Visualization Tasks

- **Easy:**
  - Visualize the popularity of various beer types (using the "Category" field) over time.
  - Show purchase patterns by day of the week for both the Front Street and Central locations.
  - Analyze purchase patterns by time of day for the Front Street and Central locations (limit to working days or weekends).
  
- **Medium:**
  - Compare the performance of the two Dram Shop locations across the entire dataset.

- **Difficult:**
  - Explore trends in beer consumption, analyzing types of beers being purchased. Use the "Category" field or request item-level data.

### City of Missoula Unhoused Data Visualization Tasks

- **Easy:**
  - Visualize aspects of client age, possibly across time.
  - Show the annual pattern of HMIS entries.
  - Visualize the change in the unhoused population over time.
  
- **Medium:**
  - Illustrate the demographic makeup of clients across ages and genders.
  
- **Difficult:**
  - Calculate the total time each client has spent in the HMIS system. Create a visualization exploring this "unhoused duration" and discuss an interesting facet of the data.

## Submission Instructions
- Submit your visualizations in a **PDF** by the due date indicated on Canvas.
- Don't hesitate to reach out with any questions!
